1) Be able to change the hashes of the attachments?? so that what?
2) Plug my own code in to do some editing on the transactions
3) Plug my own code in to do some obfusccation on the ledger data
4) DB sequences must be correct
5) Do I want flow results to be copied across?
6) Transfer custom tables

Use cases:
1) I run the entire network
2) I run my own node only
3) I'm a support providing organisation

Questions/Answers

1) Why not use the LedgerRecovery thing to distribute edited transactions across the network?
   - Because other parties than participants may have the transaction in production (e.g. Observer)

2) Why not just modify Corda signature checking mechanism to let anything pass?
   - It's not just about the signatures. The states have parties, which the flows may want to contact via the network, whilst the x500 would still be on the netmap the owning key would be different. With unclear consequences.

3) Why not dump the whole copy of the prod db somewhere and edit that db in place?
   - We would have to replace the node identities network parameters, presumably reregister in the test network. It seems easier to be dumping the data into an existing node registered on the existing network.

1) Notary database
